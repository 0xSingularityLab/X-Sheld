## Protect Your Web3 Assets from Phishing Links on Twitter

While browsing X/Twitter, we often come across ads with phishing links, especially when Web3 projects are preparing for airdrops. The number of phishing links increases exponentially through Twitter ads during these events, as shown in Figure 1.

In the comment sections of some authoritative accounts, there are also malicious comments disguised as official accounts. These comments may contain phishing links or harmful information, as shown in Figure 2.

When you click on these phishing links, they try to gain access to your Web3 wallet authorization or directly steal your Web3 assets. Every year, digital currencies worth billions of dollars are stolen through fake Twitter accounts. Therefore, it’s crucial to be able to browse X and Twitter safely.

To address this issue, Singularity Lab has developed the X-Shield plugin, which can completely prevent phishing links and malicious information from threatening you while browsing Twitter. It accurately blocks any information that may steal your Web3 assets or infect you with malware, whether from Twitter ads or phishing links in authoritative account comment sections. The effect is shown in Figure 3.
